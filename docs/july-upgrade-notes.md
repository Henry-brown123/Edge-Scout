# July Model Upgrade Notes

## 1. Structural 50–60% calibration bias

**Finding date:** 2026-06-21  
**Status:** Known limitation, not yet addressed

### What we observed

After correcting all three frozen factors (momentum, standings, injuries) and re-scoring all 8,305 historical fixtures, the calibration bands are:

| Band | n | Avg pred | Actual | Bias |
|------|---|----------|--------|------|
| <40% | 2,811 | 37.6% | 42.7% | +5.1pp |
| 40–50% | 4,119 | 44.2% | 51.2% | +7.0pp |
| **50–60%** | **1,207** | **53.8%** | **66.0%** | **+12.1pp** |
| 60–70% | 168 | 63.0% | 72.0% | +9.0pp |

The calibration factor of 1.11 brings the <40%, 40–50%, and 60–70% bands to within ~1–2pp of actual. The 50–60% band retains ~6pp residual bias even after applying the factor.

### Why it persists

The 50–60% bias is **structural to the linear weighted-sum methodology**, not a data quality issue. Evidence:

- Bias was present before and after factor corrections (bands unchanged by rescore)
- Increasing the calibration factor to close the 50–60% gap (would need ~1.225) overcorrects all other bands
- The 50–60% band is where the model places moderate-favourite fixtures. These fixtures have more genuine signal than the model's linear combination captures — the model under-commits to favourites in this range

### Implication for July upgrade

This is the primary motivation for moving to a **non-linear model** (e.g. gradient-boosted scoring, logistic regression on factor outputs, or Platt scaling per band). A single multiplicative calibration factor cannot fix non-uniform bias across confidence bands.

**Recommended approach:** Platt scaling per probability band, or train a lightweight isotonic regression layer on top of the existing factor scores. This would be a post-scoring calibration step, not a replacement of the factor pipeline.

**Priority:** High. The 50–60% band covers 14.5% of all fixtures (1,207/8,305) and has the worst calibration. These are exactly the fixtures where edge detection matters most for betting — if the model says 55% and the true probability is 66%, we are systematically underestimating value on moderate favourites.

## 2. WOWY selection bias heuristic (implemented 2026-06-21)

Added `selectionBias` flag to `getWOWYDeltas()` in `teamProfiles.js`. Triggered when:
- `withoutRate > 85%` AND `woTotal < 15` AND delta is negative (player appears to hurt the team)

Rationale: players rested only in already-won or low-risk fixtures inflate the "without" win rate. Classic examples from WC 2026 squad analysis:

- **Rodri** (Man City): -22.9pp, withoutRate=100%/5 games — almost certainly rested in comfortable wins
- **K. Walker** (Man City): -35.9pp, withoutRate=92%/13 games — small sample, likely similar pattern

The flag is surfaced in `teamIntel.keyPlayers` display and gates the WOWY probability modifier — flagged players do not apply a negative dependency adjustment to live scoring.

## 3. WOWY modifier implementation status (as of 2026-06-22)

**Status: LIVE** — implemented in `applyTeamProfileModifiers()` in commit `99ad1eb`, shipped 2026-06-22.

The modifier fires when `wowyActive=true` (now the default) and confirmed lineups are available (T-60 or later). Logic:

1. For each team (home/away), fetch high-confidence WOWY deltas (`confidence='high'`, `!selectionBias`)
2. Cross-reference against `confirmedAbsent` on the profile (populated in `scoreOneFixture()` from `lineups.json`)
3. For each absent player with `|delta| >= 0.10`: apply `delta × 0.3`, capped at ±5pp per player
4. Total cap: ±8pp per team
5. Never fires on `selectionBias: true` players

**Corrected WC squad WOWY figures** (pending lineup rebuild — current API quota used 2026-06-22):
- Højbjerg (Denmark): predicted ~-21pp post-rebuild (was -50.8pp artifact from missing 2022/23 data)
- Rodri (Spain): -22.9pp flagged `selectionBias: true` — not a reliable signal
- Walker (England): -35.9pp flagged `selectionBias: true` — not a reliable signal
- Yıldız (Turkey): +52.6pp HIGH confidence — genuine signal, small club sample
- Alexander-Arnold (England): +45.7pp HIGH confidence — 53 with / 9 without, strongest large-sample signal
- Saka (England): +25.5pp HIGH confidence — 55 with / 5 without
